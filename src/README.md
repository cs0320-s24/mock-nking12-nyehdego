# Project Details

This project creates an application that provides a command-prompt interface powered by CSS, HTML, and TypeScript with React. The application enables the user to switch output modes, perform various actions, including loading CSV data, viewing data, and searching through the data based on specific criteria while maintaining a history of all of the commands and outputs of those commands. Catered to a real-estate appraiser stakeholder for efficiently analyzing property values, this program will consider data to be inputted by the user.
